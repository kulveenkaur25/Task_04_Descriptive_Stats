# Research Task 04: Descriptive Statistics on U.S. College Scorecard Data

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task was to compute and compare descriptive statistics across various toolsâ€”**Pandas**, **Polars**, and **Pure Python**â€”on the 2021â€“22 U.S. College Scorecard dataset. The analysis focused on key metrics such as median earnings, student debt, and Pell Grant recipient percentages, grouped by U.S. states.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- **Pandas** (for comprehensive and quick analysis)
- **Polars** (for high-performance, memory-efficient processing)
- **Pure Python** (for manual, foundational understanding of operations)

```
â”œâ”€â”€ MERGED2021_22_PP.csv       # Raw data file
â”œâ”€â”€ pandas_stats.py            # Analysis using pandas
â”œâ”€â”€ polars_stats.py            # Analysis using polars
â”œâ”€â”€ pure_python_stats.py       # Analysis using pure Python
â”œâ”€â”€ performance.md             # Benchmark results
â”œâ”€â”€ visuals/                   # Output plots grouped by state

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Columns Analyzed
- `MD_EARN_WNE_P8`: Median earnings 8 years after entry
- `MN_EARN_WNE_P9`: Mean earnings 9 years after entry
- `PCTPELL_DCS`: Percent of students receiving Pell Grants
- `GRAD_DEBT_MDN_SUPP`: Median student loan debt at graduation
- `COUNT_WNE_P8`: Number of students working and not enrolled after 8 years
- `GT_25K_P8`: Fraction earning more than $25,000 after 8 years

---

## ðŸ“Š Output
- Descriptive statistics grouped by `STABBR` (state abbreviation)
- Mean, standard deviation, min, max, and mode for each column
- Visualizations saved to the `visuals/` folder
- Tool-wise performance benchmark (see `performance.md`)

## âœ… How to Run

```bash
# Pandas version
python pandas_stats.py --input MERGED2021_22_PP.csv --group_by STABBR --visuals visuals/

# Polars version
python polars_stats.py --input MERGED2021_22_PP.csv --group_by STABBR

# Pure Python version
python pure_python_stats.py --input MERGED2021_22_PP.csv --group_by STABBR
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- "PS" values in the dataset denote suppressed or privacy-protected fields.
- Visualizations are only generated in the `pandas_stats.py` script.
